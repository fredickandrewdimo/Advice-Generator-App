# Advice Generator App

The Advice Generator App is a motivational tool that generates uplifting advice through a sleek and modern interface. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app's design was inspired by a Front-end Mentor Challenge. It utilizes the Fetch API to retrieve advice from an external Advice API, providing users with a new and unique piece of advice with every click of the button.
